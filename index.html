<p>The guitar is a string instrument which is played by plucking the strings. The main parts of a guitar are the body, the fretboard, the headstock and the strings.
 Guitars are usually made from wood or plastic. Their strings are made of steel or nylon.</p>

<p>It is typically played with both hands by strumming or plucking the strings with either a guitar pick or the fingers/fingernails of one hand, while simultaneously fretting
 (pressing the strings against the frets) with the fingers of the other hand.</p>

<p>The sound of the vibrating strings is projected either acoustically, by means of the hollow chamber of the guitar</p>
